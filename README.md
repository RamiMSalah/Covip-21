# Covip-21

In short, the project is a protection system against various diseases, not only Covid-19, but also all infectious diseases, but we took Covid-19 in particular because we are at the peak of its confrontation. The device is a smart portal on which a person registers through the NFC feature and uploads his health data. The gate contains an oximeter sensor that measures the oxygen in the blood and heart rate, and the temperature sensor so that the gate decides to open and make the person enter if he is healthy. The other part is the bracelet that contains the same sensors to detect the health status and is connected to the mobile application that contains some features that could help them.
